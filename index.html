            <h2>General Kenobi ! If you did not have this reference, I would have been sad. But well, lets begin !</h2>

        <p>I mean, I know what to do and how to do things here, but lets just try to understand first some things. I will help here on some things</p>
    </div>
<div class="container">
    <h2>What could you need in this wretched world ?</h2>
    <p>Knowledge (but not only knowledge)! Knowledge is power as someone once said. Soo, lets recap some things here. First of all, take a book and open it, and then start to read. Or learn how to read... Wait, this is the wrong beginning. To help here, there are some interesting links that you can follow. For example, lets choose some random website. Havoscope (link below) is a website that lists the prices of different illegal things in the world (such as hiring a hitman in Monaco). You might say to me : "But this is <strong>not</strong> the knowledge I was searching for. <strong>True !</strong>But for a writer about murder stories, or some kind of thriller it might be.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
    <h2>And so ? </h2>
    <p>A lot of things here that you can find in the world can be deemed as useless. But you know, everything has a purpose. Just like you, with the difference being that you can decide what is your purpose. I could have written a lot of things, but let's just stop here. I let you some things here, such as some links that you will find below.</p>

<div class="container">

    <h2>Just some more info</h2>
    <p>You know, originally, it was not supposed to look like this. It was supposed to have a functionning banner and everything. But well, I dunno why, maybe I missed something but the pinguin image does not want to go in the banner. I am lost. But I might have the answer for this. Have you ever heard of spaghetti code ? It is a type of code where it is so much unstructured or difficult to maintain that when you modify something, it can crash the whole thing. Well here, maybe due to my lack of skills, The pinguin image does not fit in the background. So if it does, I am gonna put it in the following file on how it should have looked.</p>
